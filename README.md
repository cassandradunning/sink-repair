# A Sink Repair Service

Maude &amp; Merle Baumgardner were married in 1994 after a brief courtship. They are both licensed plumbers and met while working a job together on a major office building.

Sparks flew.

Now they have decided to start a family business and started a sink repair and plumbing service.

They have hired you to create a web application that will let people submit service requests that they can view quickly what needs to be done.

They want a form where a person can enter in a description of the job, the address where the work needs to be done, their spending limit for the job, and a date the work should be completed by.

Once they are done with a job, they want a way to...

1. Track who worked on the service request.
2. Once Maude and/or Merle are recorded to have finished the job, they want the UI to reflect that the job is complete.

If they don't have time to work on a particular request, they want the ability to delete it from the list.
